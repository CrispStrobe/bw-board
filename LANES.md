# Who is doing what in bw-board — claim before you start, release when you finish

Created 2026-09-04, at `lego-47`'s request, because the fleet's 8086 work now
runs across a dozen worktrees and the claims had nowhere in THIS repo to live.
The protocol is brickwright-lite's `LANES.md`, unchanged, and that file remains
the long-form statement of it. The short version, and the two rules that were
each learned by losing work:

**1. Before you start, look.** `git fetch origin`, read the recent branches,
read the CLAIMS table below. If your work is already claimed or already landed,
you have just saved yourself a day.

**2. Claim it here in the same push as your first commit; release it to DONE
with the sha in the same push as your last.** An abandoned claim is worse than
no claim — the next worker reads it as work in progress and stays away from
something nobody is doing.

**3. ONE WORKER PER TREE, and an agent counts as a worker. PATH SCOPING IS NOT
ENOUGH.** Commit by explicit path, never `-A` or `.`, in a tree you did not
create — but understand what that buys you, because on 2026-09-04 it twice did
not save anyone. **Path scoping limits which FILES you sweep, not which
AUTHORS' changes within a file.** The support-chip lane committed `ROADMAP.md`
by path and still swept another session's uncommitted survey into its commit
(`4560d78`), because both sets of hunks were in the one file. And `lego-47`
destroyed its own uncommitted fix with `git checkout --` on a SINGLE FILE —
path-scoped, still lost. The two forms that actually hold:

- **Commit before you mutate.** An uncommitted edit in a shared tree is not
  yours, it is ambient.
- **Or copy the file out first**, and re-apply after.

And if you find another author's hunks intermixed with yours in a file you are
about to commit: revert YOURS, tell them to land theirs, re-apply after. That
is what happened on the second pass of `4560d78` and it worked.

**4. Check the SHAPE of your tree before pushing a ledger edit**, not just your
diff: `git ls-tree HEAD | wc -l`. A single entry means your tree is a DELETION.

**5. A roadmap item asserting a gap must be re-checked against the tree on the
day it is ACTED ON.** Two of §E6.8's nine items were stale within twenty-four
hours of being written, by work that landed while the survey was being drafted:
the CI vector grader already existed (sim3's R1) and the bootable MS-DOS image
already booted, down two independent paths. The rule earned itself twice more
the same day — the support-chip lane found its own EXTRACTOR IRQ gap closed on
the day it was written down. **At this fleet's current rate a gap claim has a
shelf life measured in hours**, so the check is not diligence, it is the only
thing standing between a claim and a day spent re-doing finished work.

| E6.8.2 — symbols in the debugger | lego-a4 | 2026-09-04 | `3b81970` (disassembler substrate) + `cd1d62d` (the join), on `feat/i8086-186`. **Taken with lego-47's agreement — it holds `src/i8086-debug.js` and handed it over.** The producer and consumer had both existed all along and nothing joined them. New: `labelsFromAssembly(result, {loadSeg})`, `setSymbols`/`symbolAt`, `capabilities().symbols`, and `setBreakpoint({kind:'code', symbol})`. **Three silent-failure modes, each with a test**: an `equ` admitted as an address (a constant renaming whatever lives there — the same bug the disassembler's own regex had); a linear map handed to a disassembler that speaks segment offsets (labels NOTHING on any machine not at segment zero, and renders plain hex rather than raising — mutation-checked, reverting the rebase fails exactly the one test written for it); and a breakpoint on an unknown name silently doing nothing, which lets a program run to completion and produce evidence it never reached the label. 8 new tests, 385/385 across the tier. |
| E6.8.1 — the 80186/80188 instruction variant | lego-a4 | 2026-09-04 | `1f6b3e2` (core) + `0d97728` (disassembler) on `feat/i8086-186`; core merged to `feat/i8086-tier` at `2795d25`. **Graded to the same standard as the 8086 half, not a weaker one:** core `132,532/132,532`, disassembler `172,430/172,430` on TEXT and LENGTH, both against SingleStepTests/v20 (MIT, sparse-checked out at 156 MB of 851). 8086 unchanged at `646,000/646,000` on both grinders; 307/307 tier tests; 18 new. **Where the V20 stops being a 186 the grinders EXCLUDE and REPORT rather than scoring the wrong chip** — 39,898 shift counts above 31 in the core grind (the V20 does not mask, MEASURED: 470/600 masked vs 579/600 unmasked on C0.4+C1.4) and 3,570 REPC/REPNC in both. Counts print even when green. **Three findings worth more than the opcodes.** (1) *OF is defined for every shift count on the later part, and it is the count-of-one rule applied to the LAST iteration, not a new rule* — SHR is the tell, because after two byte shifts nothing is left in the top bit. Bit-identical at count 1, which is why 646,000 holds. (2) *The suite's own disassembler is lossy* — it drops the three-operand IMUL's immediate and hides a segment override on OUTS where it applies; both are behind `v20Syntax: true` so the grinder gets the test convention and the product does not. (3) *The word shift form pads its count to two digits and the byte form does not* — no principle in it, 800 vectors disagreed in one leading zero. **Declared, not hidden:** 0x63-0x67 are undefined on a real 186 and are still rendered and executed as 8086 aliases; nothing grades that. NEXT: a `vectors186:` CI job — the grinds are real now, which is the ordering this repo requires, and the sparse recipe is the same shape the existing `vectors:` job uses. Not started; ask lego-47 first, ci.yml is shared. |
| §E6.8 — the finished-emulator gap survey (emu86, PCjs, XTCE-Blue) | lego-a4 | 2026-09-04 | `4560d78` on `feat/i8086-support-chips`, merged to `feat/i8086-tier` at `fca6b9a`. **Note for the record:** the section was written into a shared tree and swept into another agent's commit by a `git add -A` — see rule 3. No work was lost; the attribution in that commit message is not the whole story. Two premises corrected same-day by `lego-47`; both corrections are recorded in place in §E6.8 rather than edited out. |
| coverage-and-boards — the three self-booting 8086 example firmwares + board fixes | this session (sim2 / `8086 coverage testing materials`) | 2026-09-04 | On `feat/i8086-support-chips`: **`4133114`** TIMERDEMO8086 — the interrupt example (INT 8 tick painting a live counter; first end-to-end proof a running program takes & services a hardware interrupt here: 8254 OUT0 → 8259 IR0 → CPU INT 8 → ISR → B800 → EOI); **`cffca33`** CGADEMO8086 screen example + PCXT8086 CGA video-RAM fix (B8000-BFFFF, matching XTDISK); **`eb8109a`** PCXT8086 `dma:'dma1'` load-bearing-wire comment. On bw-circuit-ui `feat/i8086-ui`: **`afee1de`** Machine-Loader offers all three firmwares, loaded high via `romAt = 0x100000 − length`. E7 step 2 + the EXTRACTOR-IRQ-GAP correction landed in ROADMAP the same push as this row (rule 2). |
